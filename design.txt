GAME: BREAKFAST TIME IN DREAMLAND

CONCEPT
- player is dreaming, trying to stay asleep while cats try to wake them up for breakfast
- top down shooter
	- or side view - asthetic will be easier
- flying on a magic carpet in pajamas
	- various incarnations of flying cats

GAMEPLAY
- background scrolls right to left to give illusion of movement
- player has ZZZ meter - game over when it reaches 0
	- lose ZZZs by getting hit
		- colliding with cats directly
		- failing to dodge their meows
	- regain ZZZs by collecting powerups
- defeat cats by distracting them
	- toys - cat stops to play with them, becomes harmless
	- catnip - like bomb - distracts all cats on screen?

- spawn in waves - different behaviours

- powerups
	- C - adds 3 bombs
	- P - increases fire speed
	- Z - increases Zs

- fixes
	- disable fire during intervals - done
	- delay in audio time?
		- tried disabling effects, set latency to best, disabling compression
		- no improvement
		- likely improvement: dedicated audio sources for time sensitive sounds - meow, hit, powerup?
		- this feels OK now (20220403 15:23)
	- tighten up keyboard controls - maybe done?
	- collison weirdness:
		- player can get hit more than onces from same collision (have a "hit this frame" flag? or check Invuln in collision) - done
		- player can pick up powerup more than once - have a "collected" flag - done
	
- configure builds

	- deactivate meows at X% alpha (10%?) - done
	- power up rate decreases per level - done, but tweak rate?
	- less powerups in general - see above
