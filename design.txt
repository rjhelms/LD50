GAME: BREAKFAST TIME IN DREAMLAND

CONCEPT
- player is dreaming, trying to stay asleep while cats try to wake them up for breakfast
- top down shooter
	- or side view - asthetic will be easier
- flying on a magic carpet in pajamas
	- various incarnations of flying cats

GAMEPLAY
- background scrolls right to left to give illusion of movement
- player has ZZZ meter - game over when it reaches 0
	- lose ZZZs by getting hit
		- colliding with cats directly
		- failing to dodge their meows
	- regain ZZZs by collecting powerups
- defeat cats by distracting them
	- toys - cat stops to play with them, becomes harmless
	- catnip - like bomb - distracts all cats on screen?

- spawn in waves - different behaviours

- powerups
	- C - adds 3 bombs
	- P - increases fire speed
	- Z - increases Zs

- fixes

	- tighten up keyboard controls - maybe done?
	
- configure builds

- balance
	- deactivate meows at X% alpha (10%?) - done
	- power up rate decreases per level
	- less powerups in general
	- slower growth on toy cannon rate (linear?)

	- screen shake lol
	- move types / sprites
	- foreground / background art
